      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Orlando Verdin, a web developer from Mexico. Coding and literature
        are my passions, shaping my unique approach to web development. I'm
        skilled in multiple languages and always eager to learn and stay
        up-to-date.
      </p>
      <p>
        When not coding, I love reading and finding inspiration in literature. I
        believe storytelling is key in web development, creating engaging user
        experiences.
